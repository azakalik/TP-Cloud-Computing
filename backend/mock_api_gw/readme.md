# Mock Server for AWS Lambda and API Gateway Simulation
This is a mock server built with Express.js to simulate the behavior of AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints. The server mocks endpoints related to auctions, allowing you to test your frontend or API clients without needing to set up the full AWS Lambda backend.

## Features
- GET /publications: Fetches a list of all auctions (mocked).
- GET /user/publications: Fetches a list of auctions specific to a user (mocked).
- GET /publications/: Fetches the details of a specific auction by its ID.
- POST /publications: Simulates uploading a new auction and adds it to the in-memory database.
- POST /publications/bid: Simulates placing a bid on an auction.

## Purpose
This mock server replicates the API behavior of an auction platform backend that's deployed using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It allows you to:

- Develop and test your frontend locally without connecting to the actual AWS infrastructure.
- Simulate the creation of auctions, fetching auction details, and placing bids.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine (v14 or later is recommended).
- npm package manager.
### Installation
Clone this repository or copy the code to your local machine.
Run:
```bash
npm install
```
### Running the Server

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the server on http://localhost:3000.
